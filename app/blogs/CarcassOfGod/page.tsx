                    I have studied dying stars all my life. Their collapse, their final flare, their quiet surrender into black holes, predictable, beautiful, tragic. But nothing in my equations, nothing in my telescopes, prepared me for the thing we found.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    It was not a star. Not a planet. Not a nebula. It was a body.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    The carcass of a god drifts in the infamous **Boötes void**, a wound carved into eternity itself. Its ribs stretch like shattered continents. Its flesh—if you can call it that—glimmers faintly, a light not alive yet not gone. As if existence itself cannot decide whether to let it rot or remember.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    We didn't kill it. We couldn't have. Something else did. Or maybe—terrifyingly—perhaps gods simply die.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    I am not a religious man. I grew up in the era of wars, when people butchered one another over land that was turning sterile. I saw my mother ration food so my father could keep working in the factories that built machines of death. I saw priests begging soldiers not to burn what remained of their churches. Religion became a husk—just words over the sound of artillery.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    And yet, here, staring at this divine corpse, I feel something I cannot call anything but faith. Not faith in a benevolent hand, not in salvation, but in the reality of something greater. This dead god is proof that belief was never delusion. The delusion was thinking eternity would outlast us.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    The world is burning still. Even after humanity's first voyage beyond the solar system, even after we mapped the dying edge of the universe, we dragged our wars with us. On Earth, they say it is **89 seconds to midnight**. The old clock they set after Hiroshima still ticks, only now it counts down not just to nuclear fire but to extinction itself.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    And yet, the admirals argue. The corporations argue. Even here, in orbit of a god's corpse, they argue how much energy can be harvested from its marrow. The body of eternity itself reduced to a fuel source. We are parasites gnawing on a carcass.
                </p>
                <p className="text-center italic text-gray-500 pt-4">
                    Sometimes, I think we deserve what is coming.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    I write these words in the silence of my cabin, while outside, the void hums with a sound no ear should hear. I find myself remembering my wife. She used to tell me that the stars looked fragile, like glass pinpricks in a curtain that would one day tear. I laughed at her once for saying that. Now, watching the carcass drift, I realize she was right: the curtain is already torn. The light is already leaking away. Soon, even memory will dissolve.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    I do not pray. But I confess, I sometimes whisper into the void—asking not for forgiveness, but for understanding. How does a god die? What war, what hunger, what age could bring such a being to ruin? And the darker question: if it could not endure, what chance do we have?
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    The scientists on the station continue their dissections, their measurements, their cold cataloging. They ask how long before the marrow rots, how long before the light fades. But none ask the question that claws at me each night: What if this god was not the first?
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    What if others have fallen, corpses scattered across the void, each forgotten by the next dying universe? We search for beginnings. Perhaps we should be searching for endings.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    The light outside grows dimmer each hour. I know we will not make it home. Perhaps no one will. The universe is not dying because of us; it was already sick when we were born. We were just latecomers to a funeral that began long before our kind crawled from the mud.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    I think of my wife again, her fragile laughter, the way she held flowers as if they were already dead. She was right about the stars. She was right about fragility.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    When the light fades completely, when the universe breathes its last, perhaps she will be waiting. Perhaps the god we found is only sleeping, and in its dream we will continue, formless, thoughtless, beyond logic or reason. Or perhaps not. Perhaps silence is all. And in that silence, we too will be forgotten.

                <p className="indent-8 first-letter:text-4xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-gray-400">
                    The world was already in ruins when he noticed the moon was wrong.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    At first, it was subtle. A tilt in the way it hung above the rooftops, as though it had leaned closer to listen. People were rioting in the streets over bread, water, over scraps of survival. Wars burned across borders that no longer mattered. The television droned endlessly about "89 seconds to midnight." Yet all he could think about was the moon.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    It wasn't just there anymore. It was watching, it was smiling.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    His name was Arjun. Forty-three, factory worker, widower. His wife had died two winters ago when the hospitals ran out of power and couldn't keep her alive through the pneumonia. He hadn't prayed at her bedside. He had cursed, broken bottles, screamed at the nurses, but never prayed.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    But now, when the moon followed him home like a silent eye, he whispered prayers he didn't remember learning. He spoke them not out of faith but out of fear. Words felt like stones thrown into a well too deep to hear the splash.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    At first he told himself it was grief. That losing his wife, watching his teenage son fall into anger and silence, had twisted something inside him. That the moon was the same moon as always, pale and dumb, only his own mind had cracked.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    But every night, when the streets burned with looters, when governments declared martial law, when neighbors barricaded their doors with furniture, he would step outside and feel it: that gaze. Cold, silver, eternal.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    The moon was not looking at the world. The moon was looking at him, and it was smiling.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    Arjun stopped going to work. What was the point? The factory was producing parts for weapons that would never save anyone. His son spat at him one morning and stormed out, saying he was a coward for hiding at home, for mumbling prayers into his hands while the world demanded rage.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    He let the boy go. He knew he might never see him again. But even that grief paled before the white, silent face above.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    Each night, the moon grew larger—or perhaps only closer. The light hurt his eyes now. He began wrapping his windows in cloth, but the glow bled through as if the fabric itself had turned to mist. Sleep was impossible. And in the exhaustion, the boundary between dreams and waking dissolved.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    One night, he dreamed—or thought he dreamed of his wife standing in the garden. She was pale, hair drifting like smoke, her eyes glowing with that same white fire. "It sees you," she whispered. "It always has. And it's laughing at you."
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    He woke screaming, but when he looked at the sky, the moon had not moved. Still, the words remained.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    He began reading scripture again. Not the kind preached in the hollowed-out temples now crawling with desperate scavengers, but the tattered book his mother had kept in a wooden drawer. Stories of gods who walked among men, of eyes that pierced beyond flesh, of judgment cast not by kings but by eternity itself.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    For the first time in decades, he wondered if reality mattered at all. The factories, the armies, the wars, the clocks ticking toward midnight—wasn't it all a stage, a distraction, while something older and greater stared down from above?
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    The more he thought, the more he believed. And the more he believed, the more righteous he felt. His neighbors cursed him, called him mad when he tried to warn them. "The moon is watching," he said, "and it will judge us." They laughed, or pushed him aside. But still he stood at the street corners, his hands raised, his voice breaking against the chaos of gunfire and sirens.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    Every night, the glow grew harsher. Blinding.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    On the forty-ninth day, he did not eat. He did not drink. He walked barefoot through the ruined city with his eyes fixed on the silver above. When police dragged him away for disrupting the checkpoints, he only smiled, repeating a single phrase:
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    "It watches. It remembers. It waits. And it's laughing at us."
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    And when they beat him for silence, he laughed. For the first time in years, he felt his wife beside him again. He felt faith.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    The chaos around him—wars, riots, the world choking in its own greed—no longer mattered. The factories, the missiles, the endless countdown to midnight—none of it mattered. What mattered was the gaze.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    And in that blinding chaos, Arjun was no longer afraid.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    Because if the moon was watching, then the universe still had meaning. Even if it was a cruel one.
                </p>
                <p className="text-3xl font-bold text-center text-red-400 py-4">

                <p className="indent-8 first-letter:text-4xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-gray-400">
                    Dr. Elias Navarro had always trusted numbers more than people. Equations did not betray you, not like governments or families or faith. Gravity did not lie. The speed of light was constant. Hydrogen burned predictably, oxygen fed fire, and space—space never burned.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    Until now.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    The first reports had been dismissed as atmospheric distortion. Flares of red and gold streaking across the upper exosphere, like curtains of aurora but thicker, brighter. Fire that should not exist where no air could carry it. Elias had written the official explanation himself—charged particles from solar storms, magnetosphere turbulence, a "visual phenomenon." He had written it with the cold certainty of a man who believed in laws.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    But tonight, tethered to the ISS viewing module, he saw it with his own eyes.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    The sky was burning.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    It wasn't metaphor. It wasn't poetry. It was combustion. Filaments of flame uncoiled across the black, wrapping around the Earth like arteries. Oxygen was not there to sustain it, but still it burned, a fire without fuel. His instruments screamed contradictions: temperatures in the thousands, yet no rise in local pressure; photons behaving like plasma, yet no medium to contain them. The laws were breaking.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    And then came the body.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    The first images were taken by their deep-space array: a vast silhouette drifting through the void beyond Andromeda's edge. Larger than any structure they could imagine, its mass eclipsed stars, bending light into fractures.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    A corpse.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    Its bones were pillars of collapsing matter, ribs arched like broken galaxies. Its flesh radiated a dim phosphorescence, glowing with a spectrum no model could reproduce. The carcass of something they had no words for except the forbidden one whispered in frightened conference calls: God.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    Elias had never believed. He grew up Catholic, his mother clutching rosaries in their small apartment, praying while his father coughed through a miner's lungs. He remembered the prayers doing nothing, remembered burying his father with soil that stank of iron and rain, remembered deciding then that science was the only cathedral worth entering.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    But how could science explain a corpse the size of creation?
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    The others on board began avoiding the windows. One engineer crossed himself every time the ISS rotated toward the burning sky. Another whispered Hebrew verses before sleep. Elias kept to his numbers. He calculated trajectories, mass approximations, thermodynamic anomalies. He pretended logic still mattered.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    Until the void grew.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    They called it a void, but the word was too soft. It was not absence. It was subtraction. A black sphere at the corpse's edge, expanding at a rate that defied causality. Not a black hole, not dark matter, but something else—something that erased even the possibility of being.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    His simulations told him the truth: within thirty years, maybe less, the void would swallow the Milky Way. Within fifty, the entire local cluster. A hundred years at most, and there would be nothing left to name.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    Equations confirmed it: the end of everything.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    He tried to keep it professional, clinical. He sent reports back to Earth, detailing exponential growth curves, radiation anomalies, causal inconsistencies. But one night, alone, he scribbled into his private logbook:
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    "How can air burn in space? How can fire exist without oxygen? If these laws fail, what laws remain? What is left to calculate if principles themselves are lies?"
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    He closed the logbook with shaking hands. He thought of his daughter back on Earth, sixteen years old, who still messaged him though he often forgot to reply. She had once asked him why the stars twinkled. He had explained refraction, atmospheric scattering, dismissing her awe with facts. He wished now he hadn't. He wished he had told her: "They twinkle because they are alive."
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    But the stars weren't alive anymore. They were being devoured.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    That night he looked again into the burning sky. He wanted to laugh. The Earth below was choking in wars, in riots, in greed. Nations fought over oil while the universe itself was collapsing. Humanity clawed for inches of soil while infinity crumbled at its edges.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    And still he envied them. At least on Earth, one could pretend. One could look at the moon and see only light. Up here, there was no pretending. There was only the body, and the void growing like an infection, and the knowledge that no number, no equation, no principle could stop what was coming.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    Elias Navarro, man of science, son of a miner, father to a girl he would never see again, understood something his instruments could not measure:

                <p className="indent-8 first-letter:text-4xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-gray-400">
                    I no longer know if I am awake.

                <p className="indent-8">
                    The void outside grows wider each day, and still I see Him—bones arched like continents, ribs glowing like dying suns. He is not corpse alone. He is wound. He is memory. He is sacrifice.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    The Rig Veda whispers of Purusha, the Cosmic Man, offered in fire:
                </p>
                <p className="pl-8 italic text-gray-400">
                    "The gods performed the sacrifice with Purusha as the oblation. From that sacrifice was born the hymn, from it the beasts, from it men..."
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    Perhaps this is Him. Not forgotten. Not slain. But offered.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    A God who sacrificed Himself to Himself, fracturing His own body into matter, pouring His own breath into our lungs, scattering His own mind into a billion waking creatures.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    We are not merely His creation.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    We are His consciousness, torn into fragments.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    But then the question festers: If He is sacrifice, is He also the receiver?
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    What kind of God consumes His own body? What kind of God devours His own mind? The answer echoes: the only kind.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    Perhaps He did not die at the dawn of time. Perhaps He has been dying ever since. Each war, each greed, each betrayal of His finest creation—us—is another cut in His flesh, another tear in His ribs.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    We kill ourselves, and in so doing, we kill Him.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    I begin to see it clearly now: He is dissatisfied. Disappointed. His greatest experiment—consciousness—has failed. Instead of harmony, it produced war. Instead of wisdom, it produced hunger. Instead of reverence, it produced forgetfulness.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    And so He lingers, half-alive, half-dead, gazing at the world with an eye that is both mercy and judgment. The void around Him is not hunger. It is erasure. The blackboard wiped clean, so something new may be written.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    Was that His plan all along? A cycle of sacrifice, rebirth, forgetting, beginning again?
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    Or is this the first time He has lost patience with Himself?
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    I no longer know whether He is dead, alive, or both.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    Perhaps those words have no meaning here.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    If He is dying, it is because we are dying.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    If He is forgotten, it is because we have forgotten ourselves.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    The Midnight Sun flares now, light so blinding it swallows thought. And I understand:
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    God did not die because of age, or hunger, or indifference.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    God is dying because His consciousness—us—has turned against itself.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    And perhaps He now wishes to end the dream.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    To erase His own memory.
                </p>
                <p className="indent-8">
                    To start again.

                <p className="indent-8">
                    As the void opens, I write one last line:

                <p className="pl-8 italic text-gray-400">
                    "He sacrificed Himself to Himself, and we are the wound. If He dies, we die. If He begins again... perhaps so will we."
